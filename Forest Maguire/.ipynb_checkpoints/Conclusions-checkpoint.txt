While researching what the different neighborhoods' statistics were when it came to their safety, we found that one, in particular, was coming up regularly as the least in the different data we looked at. This was Mount Oliver Borough, over the different metrics we analyzed, this was the neighborhood that had the least amount of responses from police and the fire department. This neighborhood had 92 times fewer than the neighborhood with the most responses. My favorite neighborhood is low on the list, which makes me happy, but not as low as Mount Oliver Borough. I hadn't heard of this neighborhood prior to my investigation during this project, although Mount Oliver is on the smaller side of neighborhoods, it has an engaged local government and citizens, which may impact the level of safety we find there. Through the metrics researched, we can clearly say that this is the safest of neighborhoods in the city of Pittsburgh.
